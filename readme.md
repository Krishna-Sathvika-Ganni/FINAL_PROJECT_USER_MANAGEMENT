#### üìù MY LEARNINGS FROM THIS COURSE

- I have learned many practical skills in this course, starting with how to use GitHub effectively for version control and collaboration. 
- The course introduced me to a lot of tools and ideas that I did not know about before, and made me learn a lot more about building, testing, and deploying realistic applications.
- The midterm calculator project was a stepping block that enabled me to get acquainted with the development process and prepare myself for the challenges of this Epic User Management project.


#### üíº MY EXPERIENCE WORKING ON THIS PROJECT: 
- Throughout the User Management Project, I gained first-hand experience in debugging, clean code writing, user authentication, media upload handling, and integration with third-party storage services like Minio. 
- I also understood the importance of writing thorough test cases and ensuring quality with automated tests and issue tracking. 
- This experience not only improved my technical skills but also made me understand how to approach problems in a systematic manner and work as part of a team.
- Most significantly, I achieved a very high level of confidence in creating production-grade applications that are secure, sustainable, and ready for production.


#### üõ†Ô∏è PROJECT SETUP:

1. **FORK AND CLONE THE REPOSITORY**: ```git clone https://github.com/Krishna-Sathvika-Ganni/FINAL_PROJECT_USER_MANAGEMENT.git``` 

2. **ENVIRONMENT CONFIGURATION:**
    - Create a local `.env` file.
    - And add the MailTrap SMTP settings for testing email features

3. **DATABASE MIGRATION:** ```docker compose exec fastapi alembic upgrade head```

4. **Start the project with Docker**: ```docker compose up --build```

5. **ACCESS POINTS**

- **User Management API:** `localhost/docs`
- **PGAdmin:** `localhost:5050`
- **Minio Console:** `localhost:9001`

6. **USEFUL COMMANDS**

- **To view logs for FastAPI service:** ```docker compose logs fastapi -f```

- **Execute all tests inside the container:** ```docker compose exec fastapi pytest```


#### üêû QA ISSUES:


#### üîÑ ISSUE 1: Mismatch of the Nickname

**Description:** 
- The issue is that the Create User API doesn't match the nickname stored in the database input to the request.
- It is also seen as inconsistent with API reaction and example values.
- The Nickname gets overwritten during processing, leading to inconsistencies between input, stored data and output.

**Link to the Issue Report with Screenshots:** [Mismatch of the Nickname Report](https://github.com/Krishna-Sathvika-Ganni/FINAL_PROJECT_USER_MANAGEMENT/blob/main/%F0%9F%94%84%20ISSUE%201.pdf)

**Link to the Issue:** [Mismatch of the Nickname](https://github.com/Krishna-Sathvika-Ganni/FINAL_PROJECT_USER_MANAGEMENT/issues/2)

#### üìß ISSUE 2: User ID passed as None in the Verification Email

**Description:**
- At the time of user registration, the email verification link was generated with a None user ID.
- Thus the email link becomes invalid or incomplete.

**Link to the Issue Report with Screenshots:** [User ID passed as None in the Verification Email Report](https://github.com/Krishna-Sathvika-Ganni/FINAL_PROJECT_USER_MANAGEMENT/blob/main/%F0%9F%93%A7%20ISSUE%202.pdf)

**Link to the Issue:** [User ID passed as None in the Verification Email](https://github.com/Krishna-Sathvika-Ganni/FINAL_PROJECT_USER_MANAGEMENT/issues/4)

#### üîë ISSUE 3: Verification Token Missing or Invalid

**Description:**
- User is getting a 400: Invalid or expired token for verification error.
- The verification URL is also "None," i.e., token is not being generated, not being stored, or is not being placed properly inside email verification link.

**Link to the Issue Report with Screenshots:** [Verification Token Missing or Invalid Report](https://github.com/Krishna-Sathvika-Ganni/FINAL_PROJECT_USER_MANAGEMENT/blob/main/%F0%9F%94%91%20ISSUE%203.pdf)

#### üëÆ ISSUE 4: Role Changes from Admin to Authenticated

**Description:**
- Whenever an admin user's email was verified, their role was automatically downgraded to "Authenticated". 
- This access control violation was resolved by fixing the buggy logic to preserve the original role.

**Link to the Issue Report with Screenshots:** [Role Changes from Admin to Authenticated Report](https://github.com/Krishna-Sathvika-Ganni/FINAL_PROJECT_USER_MANAGEMENT/blob/main/%F0%9F%91%AE%20ISSUE%204.pdf)

#### üîê ISSUE 5: Confusing Login Prompt Asking for "Username" Instead of "Email"

**Description:**
- The login prompt asked for a "username" when the system was looking for an email. 
- This inconsistency caused login errors and confusion.

**Link to the Issue Report with Screenshots:** [Confusing Login Prompt Asking for "Username" Instead of "Email" Report](https://github.com/Krishna-Sathvika-Ganni/FINAL_PROJECT_USER_MANAGEMENT/blob/main/%F0%9F%94%90%20ISSUE%205.pdf)

#### üñºÔ∏è ISSUE 6: Image Upload Endpoint Accepts All File Types Instead of Only Images

**DESCRIPTION:**
- The image upload endpoint was allowing any file type to be uploaded. 
- This was not secure and violated expected behavior. 
- The validation was updated to permit only JPEG, PNG, or WEBP image file types.

**Link to the Issue Report with Screenshots:** [Image Upload Endpoint Accepts All File Types Instead of Only Images Report](https://github.com/Krishna-Sathvika-Ganni/FINAL_PROJECT_USER_MANAGEMENT/blob/main/%F0%9F%96%BCissue%206.pdf)

**Link to the Issue:** [Image Upload Endpoint Accepts All File Types Instead of Only Images](https://github.com/Krishna-Sathvika-Ganni/FINAL_PROJECT_USER_MANAGEMENT/issues/13)


#### üåÑ FEATURE: Profile Picture Upload with Minio

**Description:**

- A new functionality was added that allows profile images to be uploaded by users, which are stored in Minio (an S3-compatible object store). 
- The feature includes validations for the supported image types, UUID-based renaming to ensure uniqueness, and accessible image URLs. 
- This greatly enhanced user personalization and cloud storage integration.

    - **Storage:** Uses Minio ( S3-compatible object storage )
    - **Security:** Validates image types ( JPEG, PNG, WEBP only )
    - **Uniqueness:** UUID-based filename generation
    - **Accessbility:** Public image URLs for profile display
