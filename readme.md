#### MY LEARNINGS FROM THIS COURSE
- I have learned many practical skills in this course, starting with how to use GitHub effectively for version control and collaboration. 
- The course introduced me to a lot of tools and ideas that I did not know about before, and made me learn a lot more about building, testing, and deploying realistic applications.
- The midterm calculator project was a stepping block that enabled me to get acquainted with the development process and prepare myself for the challenges of this Epic User Management project.

#### MY EXPERIENCE WORKING ON THIS PROJECT: 
- Throughout the User Management Project, I gained first-hand experience in debugging, clean code writing, user authentication, media upload handling, and integration with third-party storage services like Minio. 
- I also understood the importance of writing thorough test cases and ensuring quality with automated tests and issue tracking. 
- This experience not only improved my technical skills but also made me understand how to approach problems in a systematic manner and work as part of a team.
- Most significantly, I achieved a very high level of confidence in creating production-grade applications that are secure, sustainable, and ready for production.

#### PROJECT SETUP:
- Fork the Professorâ€™s repository.
- Clone the forked repository locally to work.
- Create a local .env file and add your MailTrap SMTP settings. This enables testing of email features during manual testing. (Note: During automated testing with pytest, email sending is mocked and not actually performed.)
- Running pytest will delete the user table, but it does not remove the Alembic migration table, which can lead to sync issues. To resolve: 
    - Drop the Alembic table manually if needed. 
    - Re-run the migration using:

```docker compose exec fastapi alembic upgrade head```

- Start the project with Docker: 

```docker compose up --build```

- Access the User Management website at localhost/docs
- Access PGAdmin at localhost:5050
- Access the Minio at localhost:9001
- To view logs for FastAPI service: 

```docker compose logs fastapi -f```

- Execute all tests inside the container: 

```docker compose exec fastapi pytest```


#### QA ISSUES:

###### ISSUE 1: Mismatch of the Nickname

**Description:** 
- The issue is that the Create User API doesn't match the nickname stored in the database input to the request.
- It is also seen as inconsistent with API reaction and example values.
- The Nickname gets overwritten during processing, leading to inconsistencies between input, stored data and output.

###### ISSUE 4: Role Changes from Admin to Authenticated

**Description:**

###### ISSUE 6: Image Upload Endpoint Accepts All File Types Instead of Only Images

**DESCRIPTION:**
- The image upload endpoint was allowing any file type to be uploaded. 
- This was not secure and violated expected behavior. 
- The validation was updated to permit only JPEG, PNG, or WEBP image file types.

#### FEATURE: ðŸŒ„ Profile Picture Upload with Minio

**Description:**
- A new functionality was added that allows profile images to be uploaded by users, which are stored in Minio (an S3-compatible object store). 
- The feature includes validations for the supported image types, UUID-based renaming to ensure uniqueness, and accessible image URLs. 
- This greatly enhanced user personalization and cloud storage integration.
